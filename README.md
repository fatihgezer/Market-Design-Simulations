# Market-Design-Simulations
Intro to computer simulations of popular matching mechanisms with examples

In this repository, I aim to give examples of how simulate infamamous matching algorithms in Python.
I will try to organize the examples in a way that the complexity of the implementation gradually increases for introductory purposes. 

Let's start:

[Excercise 1 (DA)](https://github.com/fatihgezer/Market-Design-Simulations/blob/main/DA.ipynb): One-to-one matching of men and women in the Marriage Market by Gale and Shapley (1962) by using the Deferred Acceptance algorithm (DA)

[Excercise 2 (TTC)](https://github.com/fatihgezer/Market-Design-Simulations/blob/main/TTC_0.ipynb): One-to-one matching of individuals to houses in the House Allocation problem of Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979) by using Top Trading Cycle algorithm (TTC)
